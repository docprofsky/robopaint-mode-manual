# RoboPaint: Manual Mode
An experimental automatic mode for advanced customization

This module is a mode for [RoboPaint](https://github.com/evil-mad/robopaint),
the software for drawing robots, and your
[friendly painting robot kit, the WaterColorBot](http://watercolorbot.com)!

This mode is a playground for experimental features and customization of
various Automatic paint features. Its current state is highly in flux and
not stable, nor easy to use.
